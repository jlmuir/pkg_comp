pkg_comp automates the build of pkgsrc binary packages in a sandbox.

pkg_comp is a tool to automate the maintenance of a set of binary
packages, built from the pkgsrc packaging system, by means of a single
command and configuration file.

pkg_comp orchestrates VCS tools such as CVS to fetch the initial pkgsrc
tree and to keep it up to date; the creation of a fresh sandbox to build
packages in; the pkgsrc bootstrapping process; and the use of the pbulk
infrastructure to build the desired set of packages in an optimal
manner.
